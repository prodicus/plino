## REST API usage
[:arrow_up: Back to top](#table-of-contents)

Yes, we do provide an **API** for our service!

#### using `curl`


```bash
$ curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"email_text":"<YOUR EMAIL TEXT>"}' http://plino.heroku.com/api/v1/classify/
```

**Show me an example**

You thought I was lying!

```bash
$ curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"email_text":"Dear Tasdik, I would like to immediately transfer 10000 thousand dollars to your account as my beloved husband has expired and I have nobody to ask for to transfer the money to your account. I come from the family of the royal prince of burkino fasa and I would be more than obliged to take your help on this matter. Would you care to share your bank account details with me in the next email conversation that we have? -regards -Liah herman"}' http://plino.heroku.com/api/v1/classify/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  "email_text": "Dear Tasdik, I would like to immediately transfer 10000 thousand dollars to your account as my beloved husband has expired and I have nobody to ask for to transfer the money to your account.

Would you care to share your bank account details with me in the next email conversation that we have? -regards -Liah herman", 
  "status": 200
}
```

#### using `requests`
[:arrow_up: Back to top](#table-of-contents)

How can we forget our beloved [`requests`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) module!

```python
>>> import requests
>>> import json
>>> api_url = "http://plino.heroku.com/api/v1/classify/"
>>> payload = {'email_text': 'Dear Tasdik, I would like to immediately transfer 10000 thousand dollars to your account as my beloved husband has expired and I have nobody to ask for to transfer the money to your account. I come from the family of the royal prince of burkino fasa and I would be more than obliged to take your help on this matter. Would you care to share your bank account details with me in the next email conversation that we have? -regards -Liah herman'}
>>> headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}
>>> response = requests.post(api_url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)
>>> response.status_code
200
>>> json_data = response.json()
>>> json_data['email_text']
u'Dear Tasdik, I would like to immediately transfer 10000 thousand dollars to your account as my beloved husband has expired and I have nobody to ask for to transfer the money to your account. I come from the family of the royal prince of burkino fasa and I would be more than obliged to take your help on this matter.

## FAQ
[:arrow_up: Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### What is the classifier based on 

This repo is build directly on the work I did on [prodicus/spamfilter](https://github.com/prodicus/spamfilter)

#### What did you train the classifier on

The pickled classifier was trained against a total of close to **33,000** emails picked from publicly available [enron dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/). You can find the `full_corpus` directory, which holds the training emails [here](https://github.com/prodicus/spamfilter/tree/master/data)

#### How accurate is it

I will leave that to you to decide upon. But for the questions sake, decent enough! :smile:
